So you want to confidently update your CV with hot-and-sexy AI, LLM/RAG just like chatGPT, but the path is so foggy?


Don’t worry bros, here is the plan for genius like you:


# DAY 1: LM Studio, Chainlit, Resume.

### Step 1: 
Download LM Studio (to hold LLM model) -> download Mistral 7B -> turn on LM Studio server (aka localhost:1234).

### Step 2:
In Python conda, download Chainlit (to create user interface).

### Step 3: 
Download the simple code here https://github.com/longmaisg/LLM-RAG-Lessons/blob/main/test.py (it just forwards your prompt on Chainlit UI to LLM server on LM Studio).

### Step 4: 
Run “chainlit run test.py”, et voila, you have your first LLM server with kool web interface. Congratulation!

### Step 5: 
Proudly update your CV with this statement: “**Build LLM server, LM Studio, Chainlit**”. Don’t worry, LLM is quite new so no one actually knows enough to blame you not skillful enough :).

### Step 6: 
Show this magical Chainlit UI to your boss and ask for a raise.

### Step 7: 
Your boss shows you the fastest route to the door. You visit my post again to read # DAY 2 coming soon.
